           wineSelectionText: "Aglianico is deep, intense ruby purple in color. This hearty red wine has rich aromas of black fruit such as blackcurrants and blackberries along with spicy notes of cocoa and smoke. The tannins are ripe, soft and make for a long, full-bodied texture yet balanced by good acidity which gives it a true sense of finesse. This robust red is a perfect match with grilled or braised red meat, osso buco, hearty legume-based soups and medium-aged herbed cheeses.",

           wineSelectionImage: "2019 San Salvatore Rosato Vetere",
           wineSelectionText: "The aromas on the 2019 San Salvatore Vetere reminds me more of food than wine, and I mean that in the best possible way, as it pulls me closer to the glass with a display of savory herbs and citrus, blossoming further to reveal young peach with peppery florals and a hint of undergrowth. It washes across the palate with feminine weight, as a mix of ripe orchard fruits greet the senses, framed by brisk acids and a hint of subtle sweet spice. The finish is medium in length, taking on an almost-salty character, which only further accentuates the savory qualities of this Aglianico Rosato. Very nice.",

           wineSelectionName: "2019 Quinta De Soalheiro Alvarinho",
           wineSelectionImage: "2019 Quinta De Soalheiro Alvarinho",
           wineSelectionText: "The 2019 Alvarinho, the so-called unoaked classico, is dry (three grams of residual sugar and 6.9 grams of total acidity) and comes in at 12.5% alcohol. On paper, this has a somewhat crisper demeanor than the 2018. Due to more cool days in 2019 and a harvest in the first week of September, the winery said the acidity was slightly higher with lower pH, and in their opinion, that contributed to the profile of Soalheiro. Comparing this to the Granit, as always, leads you to two completely different wines. The Granit seems lighter, tenser and more energetic. It is precise and focused. This does all that too, but the balance with the fruit is different—often, I say better, but not this year. The expression of fruit here is pure Alvarinho, but the Granit is no slouch. This Classico is ripe but lifted, though. It's pretty tasty in its youth too. Like the Granit, though, this might be better next year—although this is more approachable. They both will age well, as the winery's track record in general has frequently demonstrated over the years. (I still like to stay conservative in the drinking windows. You might not think 11 years is conservative for a Vinho Verde, but here it might well be.) This looks terrific this year, and it's a typically super value.",
